2. **Business Operations** — Running VORTEX in a company with 10+ employees
3. **Revenue-Generating Systems** — Using VORTEX to generate revenue directly or indirectly

6. **Closed-Source Derivatives** — Proprietary modifications or integrations in commercial products

### Terms

- **Duration:** Annual license (renewable)
- **Deployment:** Licensed for unlimited internal deployments within the purchasing organization
- **Modifications:** You may modify VORTEX internally; modifications remain your property
- **Resale:** You may NOT resell, white-label, or embed VORTEX in your commercial product without explicit agreement

## Part C: License Compliance & Enforcement

### How to Choose Your License

**Use Part A (Personal/OSS) if:**
- Your project is not generating revenue
- You're publishing code under an OSI-approved open source license
- You're using VORTEX for learning, research, or hobby purposes
- You're a student or educator

**Use Part B (Enterprise) if:**
- Your company uses VORTEX to deliver products or services
- VORTEX runs in a commercial SaaS or managed service
- You integrate VORTEX into proprietary products you sell
- Your organization has $1M+ annual revenue (or 10+ employees)

### License Verification

- Open source projects must clearly document use of VORTEX
- Commercial deployments will be checked against the license registry
- Violations will trigger cease-and-desist + licensing demand

### What Happens if You Don't License?

Unlicensed commercial use is a **breach of contract**. We reserve the right to:
1. Send a licensing notice with 30-day cure period
2. Demand retroactive licensing fees (3x annual license cost)
3. Pursue legal action for damages if not remedied
